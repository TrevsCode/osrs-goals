# OSRS Goals Board 🦀

A goal tracker for the boys. No downloads, no accounts, no nonsense — just click and track.

## How to Use

**Mark a goal complete:** Click it. It turns green. You feel good.

**Edit a tile:** Right-click → Edit Content. Add text or an image URL (OSRS Wiki images work great).

**Edit titles:** Just click on them.

**Filter sections:** Click the section buttons at the top to show/hide what you want.

**Save your progress:** Hit "Save Progress" to download a backup file. Your browser remembers everything automatically, but if you ever clear your cookies... you'll want that backup.

**Load your progress:** Hit "Load Progress" and select your backup file. Crisis averted.

**Reset everything:** There's a button for that. It'll ask if you're sure. You probably aren't.

## Notes

- Everything saves in your browser. Nothing goes to a server. Your data is yours.
- Each person has their own board — progress isn't shared between users.
- Works on mobile too if you're grinding on the go.
